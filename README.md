# skellygore's scoop bucket

Focusing on video game music ripping software I find useful, mostly taken from [this](https://highquality.rip/ripguide/part-3-getting-editable-music) and [this guide](https://loveemu.github.io/vgmdocs/Conversion_Tools_for_Video_Game_Music.html).

## Install
First [get scoop](https://scoop.sh/). Then add the bucket with:
```
scoop bucket add skellygore https://github.com/skellygore/scoop-bucket
```
(You can choose any name you want besides skellygore really).

## Remove
```
scoop bucket rm skellygore
```
